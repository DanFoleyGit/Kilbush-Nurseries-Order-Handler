App name: Kilbush Nurseries Order Handler

Description: This app is to help staff at a local farm where I work summers to track order amounts and organise the load for shipping. The app has three main use cases and features. The first is the ability to input orders into a database. The second is to view the orders using a calendar and the third is to use a calculator that allows users to input the order numbers and see the best way to package/ship the products.     

The business has two main costumers that have orders every day, Tesco and Lidl. For each customer there is an option to input and view orders and use a relevant calculator. Each customer uses the same 3 activities but with modifications to accommodate the products that they use.
